As always:
Not for profit, not doing this for any compensation.
Why do I record? I'm an audio person, not here for the visuals or the party. If the artist doesn't have a full audio line-in recording, I gotta make it for myself. I record so I can hear the audio later in peace. If I could have it my way, I would never attend a single live non-classical concert.
